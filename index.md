I'm a computer engineer from Egypt. I've received my B.Sc. from the Computer Engineering Department at Cairo University. I've been working as machine learning research engineer since 2016. I have an experience in modern artificial intelligence including machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.

In industry, I'm currently working with Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) as a Sr. machine learning engineer. I'm also working with an Egyptian AI startup called Webville as an AI team lead. 

In academia, I'm currently working as a research assistant (RA) at the military technical college in Egypt. I've also worked as a teaching assistant (TA) at Cairo University.

Previously, I used to work in the Deep Learning Research Team at Valeo Egypt.
