I have more than 5 years of experience working in the research and development of ML software including natural language processing and computer vision systems. I like building software systems from scratch that have machine learning pipelines as core components. So, I built and contributed to multiple ML products in different companies from the research phase to production. I also have experience in the deployment and optimization of machine learning software. I published several research papers in the top AI conferences around the world such as NeurIPS, CVPR, IROS, ICIP. 

I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Cairo University and was ranked as the top student in my class.
